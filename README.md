# The Notes and Exercises of <Essential CPP>

## Chapter 1 
## Chapter 2 
The pointer to const value does not really influence the value change of the pointed variable, but if changing the pointed variable by dereferencing the pointer, CPP does not allow to.

## Chapter 3
STD is made by two parts: 1. Containers 2. Generic Algorithms

Generic Algorithms:
    
    1. Generic from data type:

        By function template

    2. Generic from container type:

        By defining Iterator 

Container has two types: 

    1. consecutive containers.

        vector, list

    2. linked containers

        map:

            Check key-value

        set:

            Check availability
